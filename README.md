## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to perform a keyword-based classification on different Bangla contents. The Keyword Based Classifier is a simple classifier that searches for repeating string sequences within a given file, in order to perform document classification. There are no websites that can classify and recommend safe Bangla content for under aged individuals. To protect our minors from abusive content we developed our system as a keyword-based classifier, which classifies contents into three categories: political, religious, and abusive.  Based on the intensity of the words of different categories we set a threshold for recommending contents for minors.

## Features

1. Review existing methods for classifying different types of Bangla content.
2. Apply our proposed preprocessing and highly modified dataset to classify the content.
3. Implement uni-gram, bi-gram, and tri-gram based comparison techniques as discussed.
4. Apply the proposed comparison algorithm to the Bangla dataset.
5. Develop an end-to-end system for online Bangla content classification and recommendation.
6. Design user-friendly web applications for optimal user experience.
7. Expand the principles of online keyword-based classification techniques to real-world scenarios.
8. Review the challenges we faced.
